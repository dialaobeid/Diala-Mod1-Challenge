# Diala-Mod1-Challenge
My module 1 challenge description:

1. This github repository is made to store and update the starter code, with this README containing a brief description of the challenge 
2. The starter code is cloned onto this repository in order to begin the challenge
3. The code will be periodically refactored until it is complete for submission
4. The assignment is only complete for submission once the acceptance criteria and all the instructions are met 
5. A URL of the resulting application and a URL of this repository containing all the code will be submitted via Bootcamp Spot to be viewed and graded

Note: the starter code was cloned from the shared link: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram

the refactored code was then uploaded onto this repository
